# Kmeans
In this project I solve the problem of labeling images. With given images I'll create a K-means algorithm to classify what is the color that prevail from the others.
To simplify this process we will have 11 basic colors. In a future it may be interesting to take all the RGB colors as an improvements of the projects. 
Also it's quite interesting how to initialize the centroids of the images. As an improvement we could create an algorithm to find where is the best place to center those centroids.
