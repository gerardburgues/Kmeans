# Kmeans
In this project I solve the problem of labeling images. With given images I'll create a K-means algorithm to classify what is the color that prevail from the others.
To simplify this process we will have 11 basic colors. In a future it may be interesting to take all the RGB colors as an improvements of the projects. 
Also it's quite interesting how to initialize the centroids of the images. As an improvement we could create an algorithm to find where is the best place to center those centroids. 


####This project has been related with the university and has been graded with an excellent mark. The tests made by the university are not currently in the repository.

#####In the repository there is the K-means algorithm that I used to solve the problem and utils.py ( functions that I may have used while coding the algorithm )
